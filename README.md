# golenny ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Heavily inspired by [RESTful-lenny](https://github.com/LennyToday/RESTful-lenny),
golenny aims to deliver similar Lenny functionality in a package form, with the end goal
being improved performance and less reliance on external systems by bundling this module
with your other dependencies.
